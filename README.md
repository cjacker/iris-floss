# iris-floss
Floss is implementation of blue light reduction software like Iris, f.lux, Redshift, Night Shift with 10 lines of code and minimum dependencies made for Linux.

The only requirement to run Floss is to have Linux running with X11.

Since this project is open source you need to build it from source. To build Iris Floss just run

```
make
```

in the iris-floss.c folder and then

```
./iris-floss
```

# How to use

You can customize Color temperature and Brightness with command line arguments

```
./iris-floss 5000 90
```

Will set Color temperature to **5000K** and Brightness to **90%**

Specially for all all people who like Linux.

With love,
Daniel :)
